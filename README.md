## Setup and installation
1. Clone this repository or download the `userChrome.css` file to your local machine
2. On Firefox, go to `about:config`, click *"Accept the Risk and Continue"* and enable `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`
3. Go to `about:profiles`, locate your profile under *"This is the profile in use and it cannot be deleted"* and open the directory
4. On the profile directory folder, open (or create) the folder `chrome`
5. Copy the `userChrome.css` file to `chrome`
6. Restart the browser to apply the theme

## Recommendation
It looks better with the [Adaptative Tab Bar Color](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adaptive-tab-bar-colour/) extension.
